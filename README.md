# Scrapy small project

Project made using Scrapy. Contains of two simple Spiders for searching products through two biggest cosmetic websites in Ukraine.

How to test/use:

- ***crawler_runner.py*** - is a starting point of the project. Run this file to make all spiders work.

To update project with your own spiders just add new ones to the ***spiders*** folder.

- ***items.py*** - is where you can define a model of data.
- ***items.json*** - is a sample of how your crawled data will look after script stops. It is better to clean this file or delete it before testing project.
